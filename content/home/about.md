# Biography

I am a Data Scientist at the Deep Vision Group at Flipkart, which is headed by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/krishhomepage/Home">Dr. Krishnendu Chaudhury</a>. My work is centered around Deep Learning and its application in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Personalised Recommendations.

My goal in life is to build intelligent machines that can make this world a better place to live.

Academics apart, I am a huge sports enthusiast. I was a part of my institute's Badminton team and I enjoy playing and watching soccer.
